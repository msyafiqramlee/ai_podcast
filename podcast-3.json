Welcome to Cybersecurity Today. It's Wednesday, August 16, 2023. I'm Howard Solomon, contributing reporter on cybersecurity for ITWorldCanada.com and TechNewsday.com in the U.S. Users of the independent Discord I.O. platform, which allows users to create custom invites to the Discord Instant Messaging Service, has confirmed its member database was stolen. This comes after someone posted the data of 760,000 Discord I.O. users for sale on a Darknet forum. In response, Discord revoked the authentication tokens of Discord I.O. users. They will have to re-authenticate with new passwords and enable multi-factor authentication. Discord I.O. says it believes the breach was caused by a vulnerability in its website code, allowing an attacker to copy the database. The data includes subscribers' Discord username and email address. Discord I.O. is overhauling its website code and security practices, but meanwhile, it's offline. Recently locked out of your LinkedIn account. You're not alone. According to researchers at CyberInt, a threat actor is successfully compromising and taking over LinkedIn accounts all over the world. Some victims are being pressured into paying a fee to get their access back. The report doesn't say exactly how accounts are compromised. Likely they're using brute force password attacks. If the attackers try to get around two-factor authentication, the account is frozen until the real owner can verify their identity. However, if the attacker takes control over the account, the real owner can't do anything. The report notes that compromised accounts can be used for phishing or scams. If you still have access to your LinkedIn account, make sure the contact information hasn't changed and your password is long and unique. And for heaven's sakes, if you haven't enabled two-factor authentication, do it now. More American organizations indirectly hit by the vulnerability in MoveIt file transfer servers are emerging, VNS Health Plans, which offers home, behavioral, and hospice healthcare services in New York State, has admitted that the data on over 103,000 patients was copied when the MoveIt server of a claims processor it uses, called TMG Health, was hacked. TMG Health is owned by professional IT services company Cognizant. Files copied included people's names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, medical claims information, and more. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico says that over 82,000 of its customers had their data copied when the MoveIt server of accounting firm PWC was compromised. Information included names, social security numbers, and mortgage information. Milliman Inc., which provides administrative services for employee benefit and pension plans, says data on over 44,000 of its customers was copied when the MoveIt server of pension benefit information was hacked. Now I've mentioned before that several organizations using PBI for data processing have admitted being victimized when that company's MoveIt server was compromised. One of them is New York Life Insurance, which this week said data on over 25,000 customers was copied as part of the BBI hack. Information about the hackers on your network may be closer than you think. Researchers at Hudson Rock analyzed 14.5 million computers infected with information-stealing malware and found 120,000 of them had credentials associated with cybercrime forums. Now that could help identify the real identities of hackers, but it also means that the computers used by hackers are also infected with information-stealing malware. This type of malware looks for saved credentials, data used to autocomplete forms, and credit card information. The most common information-stealing malware are Redline, Raccoon, and Azzelroot. Speaking of the Raccoon Stealer, after the person responsible for the malware's infrastructure was arrested in October, the gang decided to rebuild their operation. According to researchers at VX Underground and CyberInt, after a six-month hiatus, they're back. New features for the threat actor customers using the Raccoon malware as a service have been added, and these features include the ability to block IP addresses used by security pros to monitor Raccoon traffic. Network administrators with Citrix Neck Scaler application delivery controllers on their networks are urged to install a security update if they haven't already done so. The patch has been available for almost a month. According to researchers at NCC Group, as of Monday, just over 1,800 devices around the world were still compromised. And finally, on Monday's podcast, I complained that there were no details on an announced Canadian government consultation to develop a voluntary code of practice for companies in this country using generative artificial intelligence applications. Yesterday, I heard back from the Innovation Department with a few things. There will be a roundtable discussion process before September 14. They will hear from experts, academics, Canadian AI research institutes, and public groups. Details on how to participate will be released shortly. And by the way, separately, at some point, witnesses will be invited to Parliament to testify about the government's proposed Artificial Intelligence Data Act. That's it for now.

The data of 760,000 users was posted for sale on a Darknet forum. Discord has responded by revoking authentication tokens of Discord I.O. users, requiring them to re-authenticate with new passwords and enable multi-factor authentication. Discord I.O. attributes the breach to a vulnerability in its website code.\n\nNext, a threat actor is targeting and taking over LinkedIn accounts worldwide, with some victims being coerced into paying a fee to regain access. The exact method of compromise is not disclosed, but it is speculated that brute force password attacks may be involved. The compromised accounts pose a risk for phishing or scams, highlighting the importance of strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.\n\nFurthermore, more organizations in the U.S. have been indirectly affected by vulnerabilities in MoveIt file transfer servers. VNS Health Plans, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, and Milliman Inc. have confirmed data theft from their respective servers, compromising personal information such as names, addresses, social security numbers, and medical claims.\n\nResearchers have also discovered that computers infected with information-stealing malware often have credentials associated with cybercrime forums. This finding can potentially aid in identifying the real identities of hackers, but it also means that the computers used by the hackers are compromised as well. The most common information-stealing malware types mentioned are Redline, Raccoon, and Azzelroot.\n\nThe Raccoon Stealer, which operates as malware-as-a-service, recently returned with new features after the infrastructure operator was arrested. The updated version includes the ability to block IP addresses used by security professionals to monitor Raccoon traffic.\n\nNetwork administrators using Citrix Neck Scaler application delivery controllers are advised to install a security update to prevent compromise. As of the podcast recording, over 1,800 compromised devices worldwide had not applied the patch, according to NCC Group researchers.\n\nLastly, the Canadian government has announced a consultation process to develop a voluntary code of practice for companies using generative artificial intelligence applications. The Innovation Department plans to conduct a roundtable discussion involving experts, academics, research institutes, and public groups. Additionally, witnesses will be invited to testify about the government's proposed Artificial Intelligence Data Act in Parliament.\n\nListeners are encouraged to visit ITWorldCanada.com for additional details and stories.

Enable multi-factor authentication: The breach of the Discord I.O. platform highlights the importance of enabling multi-factor authentication to enhance security and protect our accounts.\n\n2. Secure your LinkedIn account: LinkedIn accounts are being compromised, likely through brute force password attacks. It is crucial to have a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication for added protection.\n\n3. Be cautious of data breaches: Several organizations using MoveIt file transfer servers have been affected by data breaches. It is important to be vigilant about sharing personal information and regularly monitor for any suspicious activities.\n\n4. Protect against information-stealing malware: Information-stealing malware, such as Redline, Raccoon, and Azzelroot, can compromise our saved credentials and sensitive data. Ensure that your devices have updated security measures and regularly scan for malware.\n\n5.
